<p>The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the high cost of drug overdoses in the U.S., with provisional data from the CDC estimating <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2021/20211117.htm">more than 100,000 overdose deaths</a> in the year ending in April 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>The National Center for Health Statistics notes that's an increase of nearly 29% from the deaths recorded in the same period the year before.</p><p>"We have failed to truly harness the power of technology in responding to the opioid and overdose epidemic over the past 20 years," Kasey Claborn,&nbsp;assistant professor at the University of Texas and Andrea L. Daugherty, interim chief information officer at Dell Medical School at the University of Texas Austin, wrote to <i>MobiHealthNews</i>.</p><p>"Until recently, public funding has been insufficient to support the widespread need for evidence-based addiction treatment and prevention services. <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/reports/rpt29393/2019NSDUHFFRBriefSlides082120.pdf">SAMHSA data</a> show that in 2019 only 10% of those needing treatment for addiction in the U.S. actually received it."</p><p>Their team spent the past two years working with communities in Texas to design a better system for overdose response, allowing people to anonymously report overdoses and catch nonfatal cases that don't make it to the health system. They just wrapped up a pilot program implementing the platform, called TxCOPE (Texans Connecting Overdose Prevention Efforts), at harm reduction organizations across four counties in the state.</p>
