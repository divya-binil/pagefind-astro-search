<p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Madaket Health, a leading provider data management platform enabling automated information flow between healthcare payers and providers, announced the addition of state medical licensing and credentialing services coming to the Madaket Health platform in partnership with Licentiam, a trusted and experienced solution provider that streamlines the licensing process for all healthcare providers.
The Licentiam partnership allows Madaket customers who are providers and administrative staff to work with a team of experienced medical regulatory and licensing experts to complete and maintain state licensing applications directly from the Madaket Provider Data Management (PDM) platform. Madaket’s PDM platform is used by more than 80% of U.S. provider groups to exchange data for key healthcare administrative functions like payer enrollment, credentialing, and licensing. “Getting and retaining a provider’s state licensure can be a time-intensive process that only adds to the workload burden our healthcare providers are experiencing,” said Eric Demers, Chief Executive Officer of Madaket Health.
The licensing and credentialing services in the Madaket platform are available for all healthcare provider types, including, but not limited to, doctors, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, psychologists, respiratory therapists, and telehealth practices.</p>
